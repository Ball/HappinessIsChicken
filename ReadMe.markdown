# Happiness Is Chicken

This is an excuse to explore simple game making technologies for macOS, iOS, and tvOS.  It's based on a plot point from a [Peppa Pig episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4th8lUmAuzs).  The HTML5 Canvas / JS prototype has already made my daughter very happy.

## HTML5 Features

* 1 Mrs. Chicken walks to where you click
* Once she stops moving, she lays an egg
* The eggs will hatch after 3 seconds, or hatching season starts.  Which ever comes last
* Chicks immediatly run off the screen (left or right)
* Hatching season starts after 10 eggs are on the screen and ends once all chicks have run off the screen

## macOS TODO

[*] Mrs. Chicken walks to where you click
[*] Once she stops moving, she lays an egg
[*] Once 10 eggs have ben layed, hatching season starts
[*] BUG: Eggs and Chicks are miss-scaled in relation to Mrs. Chicken
[*] Chicks run off the screen
[*] Eggs hatch durring hatching season and have a 3 second timer (since laid)
[*] Hatching season ends when all eggs are hatched and all chicks are off the screen
[*] Hatching season can restart
